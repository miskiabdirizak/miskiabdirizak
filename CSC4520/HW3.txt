1) Assuming T is defined in Java, what code do I write to get "sun" back?

/*Solution*/
System.out.println(T.getChildren().get(0).getChildren().get(0).getValue()); 


2) What will  System.out.println(T.getChildren().get(2).getChildren())
output? Be as specific as possible.

/*Solution*/
  When we first do "t.getChildren() we will get the first level of children nodes of the tree, which are
  "lit", "cap", and "cat. From there, when we run.get(2), we retrieve the node qirh index=2, which is "cat". 
  Then, when we do .getChildren() again, it will retrieve all of the children nodes under "cat". Since we only used .getChildren(), the output will not be the value of the retrieved 
  node but rather, the line of code will print a list of the objects that are children of "cat". There is only 
  one child node under "cat", which is "pup". So it will output a list of the "pup" node's address. 

**Build the tree in replit and try to solve all of the

3) Given the following code, what will we output for mystery(T)?

public static void mystery(TreeNode<String> node) {
  List<TreeNode<String>> children = node.getChildren();
  for (int i = 1; i < children.size(); i++) {
    TreeNode<String> child = children.get(i);
    System.out.println(child.getValue());
    mystery(child);
  }

/*Solution*/
  This function prints out the value of all of the children nodes except for the root node.
